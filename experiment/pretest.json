      "question": "The greater the surface area of the packing of the fractionating column,",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Efficiency doesn't depends on the surface area of the column",
        "b": "The faster the distillation will proceed",
        "c": "The lower its efficiency",
        "d": "The greater its efficiency"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Efficiency is directly related to surface area.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Speed depends on heat rate, not surface area.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Greater surface area improves separation, not lowers it.",
        "d": "Correct. More surface area improves the efficiency by allowing better separation."

      "question": "When the vapour pressure of a liquid equals atm pressure, the temperature of the liquid equals:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The Vapourisation point",
        "b": "The normal boiling point",
        "c": "100Â°C",
        "d": "The boiling point"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Partially correct, but the precise term is 'boiling point'.",
        "b": "Correct only at 1 atm; 'boiling point' is more general.",
        "c": "Only true for water at 1 atm.",
        "d": "Correct. Boiling occurs when vapour pressure equals atmospheric pressure."

      "question": "Two completely miscible liquids can be separated by",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Steam distillation",
        "b": "Separating funnel",
        "c": "Fractional distillation",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Used for immiscible liquids.",
        "b": "Used for immiscible liquids.",
        "c": "Correct. Fractional distillation is ideal for separating miscible liquids with different boiling points.",
        "d": "Used to separate solids, not liquids."

      "question": "In distillation of a mixture of two components, the first compound to condense into the receiving flask will be:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The one with the lower boiling point",
        "b": "The one with the higher melting point",
        "c": "The one with the lower melting point",
        "d": "The one with the higher boiling point"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The compound with lower boiling point evaporates and condenses first.",
        "b": "Melting point is unrelated in this context.",
        "c": "Melting point is not a factor in distillation.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The higher boiling compound comes over later."
