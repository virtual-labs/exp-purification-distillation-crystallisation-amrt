        "a": "The one with the higher melting point",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – Melting point is irrelevant in distillation.",
        "b": "Incorrect – Same reason as above.",
        "c": "Correct – Lower boiling point compounds vaporize and condense first.",
        "d": "Incorrect – They condense later, not first."
