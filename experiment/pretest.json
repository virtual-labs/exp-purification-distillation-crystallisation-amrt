      "question": "The greater the surface area of the packing of the fractionating column,",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The lower its efficiency",
        "b": "Efficiency doesn't depends on the surface area of the column",
        "c": "The faster the distillation will proceed",
        "d": "The greater its efficiency"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – Larger surface area typically improves efficiency.",
        "b": "Incorrect – Surface area does affect efficiency.",
        "c": "Incorrect – Speed isn't necessarily improved by surface area.",
        "d": "Correct – Greater surface area provides more surface for condensation and evaporation cycles, improving separation."

      "question": "When the vapour pressure of a liquid equals atmospheric pressure, the temperature of the liquid equals:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The boiling point",
        "b": "The Vapourisation point",
        "c": "The normal boiling point",
        "d": "100°C"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct – By definition, this is the boiling point.",
        "b": "Incorrect – Vaporisation point is a broader term.",
        "c": "Incorrect – Normal boiling point refers to 1 atm pressure.",
        "d": "Incorrect – Only true for water at 1 atm."
